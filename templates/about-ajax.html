        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Nice to meet you! I'm William, and this is my web page.</p>
        <p>I'm a web developer, currently located near Washington, DC, but sometimes found in Mexico City, where I took classes in Ruby on Rails, or in China, where I taught English and looked for ways to access the real internet.  </p>
        <p>These days, I'm looking for new challenges in anything related to the web and computers, including front-end work, back-end work, and data analysis (my formal training is in Economics).</p>
        <p>For a few more details, take a look at my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4YKsHrxnahobW1kVV9rdWZBVVE" target="_blank">résumé</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/wbruntra" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page.
